#### Winter 2018 - TCSS-580


-------

This is the Git-Hub Repository for the some of the Java code used to solve the problems on the mid-term of **TCSS-580**: *Information Theory* class during the ***Winter of 2018***.  The code is divided into folders at two levels.  The first level of division is based on the IDE used to work on the code (*NetBeans* vs *Eclipse* vs *etc*).  The second level of division is contained within the IDE folders and is based on which problem is being solved by the code within.  Additionally, there is a folder for the text files being used as source material (**[ *ROOT REPO PATH* ]** */ Text-Files*).
